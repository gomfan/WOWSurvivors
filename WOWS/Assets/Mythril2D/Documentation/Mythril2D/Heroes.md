# Heroes
> On this page, we'll learn about heroes.

## Hero <`Character`>
A `Hero` is a component derived from `Character`, so it inherits all the movement and combat logic while adding a customizable attribute layer (so they can unlock and assign points) and an equipment system.

## HeroSheet <`DatabaseEntry`> (*Create > Mythril2D > Characters > HeroSheet*)
A `HeroSheet` allows you to define how your hero acquires attribute points, as well as its base stats and abilities.

**ℹ️ Heroes come with a camera and are set up to use a `PlayerController`. If you want to edit the camera settings of your game, you can open the `0_Hero_Base` prefab and find the camera there!**
