> On this page, we'll learn about Mythril2D items.

## Item <`DatabaseEntry`> (*Create > Mythril2D > Items > Item*)
In Mythril2D, an item is an object that can be acquired (e.g., as a quest reward, or loot), disposed of (e.g., selling, or using), used for quests (as things you need to collect), or used for crafting. Items have a price at which they can be bought or sold in shops (see Shops & Inns), and by default, have no effect when used. You can select what should happen when the player tries to use an item by filling out the "On Use" setting.

## Equipment <`Item`> (*Create > Mythril2D > Items > Equipment*)
An `Equipment` in Mythril2D refers to an item that a hero can equip. While equipped, the hero will benefit from the bonus stats and abilities, specified in the equipment settings. Currently, equipment isn't restricted by weight or class, and any hero can equip any piece of equipment.

## Selling Items
By default, items can only be sold if their price is greater than 0, and if their category is different from "Key".
