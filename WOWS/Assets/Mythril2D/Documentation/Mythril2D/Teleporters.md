## Teleporter <`Checkpoint`>
A `Teleporter` is a type of checkpoint that can teleport the player from one location to another within the same map or to another map. Teleporters are essential for map transitions (such as moving from outside to inside) and for implementing specific gameplay mechanics. They can be configured to teleport the player on contact when the player moves in a certain direction. Additionally, teleporters can be set to play a sound when teleportation occurs.

## Creating a teleporter
To add a teleporter to your map, drag and drop the `Teleporter` prefab from the demo game into your scene, then configure its settings in the `Teleporter` script component.
