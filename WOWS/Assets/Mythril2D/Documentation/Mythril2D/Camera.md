# Camera
> On this page, we'll learn about the camera in Mythril2D.

## Where is the camera?
In Mythril2D's demo game, the camera is a child of the `0_Hero_Base` prefab. Because it’s parented to the hero (the player), it will always follow them.

## Moving the camera
You can move the camera using the "Move Camera" command. This can be useful for cinematics. For example, when the player first enters Edlham_Village, or during key moments like meeting Joe in the plains.
