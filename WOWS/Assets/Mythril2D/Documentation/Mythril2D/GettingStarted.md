# Getting Started
> This page covers the fundamentals of Mythril2D and how to get started.

## What is Mythril2D?
Mythril2D is a toolkit designed to help game developers create 2D action RPG games easily and efficiently. With Mythril2D, you can bring your unique ideas and vision to life without needing to write code.

## Where should you start?
To help you through your game development journey with Mythril2D, here are some features and systems that you should get familiar with first:

- **Scriptable Objects**: Used extensively by Mythril2D, you need to be familiar with them before getting started.
- **Commands**: You'll hear this term a lot with Mythril2D! Commands are Mythril2D-specific gameplay blocks that you can use, assemble, and execute from many locations in your game: when your player interacts with something, at the end of a dialogue, in the middle of a quest, when your player dies, etc. I **highly** recommend reading the documentation about commands!
- **Conditions**: Also Mythril2D-specific, conditions are mostly used to determine which command should be executed based on the context (if the player has an item, if a quest is in progress, etc.). I recommend getting familiar with them by reading the related documentation; you'll definitely need them!
- **Characters**: They are at the heart of Mythril2D. NPCs, Heroes, and Monsters are all characters, so consider reading about them!
- **Database**: A must. The database (accessible through "Window > Mythril2D > Database") lists all your game-related data: abilities, items, save files, character sheets, quests, dialogues, etc. Get familiar with it! You'll browse it a lot!

> **Note:** The demo game is an invaluable resource for learning and understanding how Mythril2D works. Spend some time exploring each map, particularly under the "Gameplay" GameObject. Draw inspiration from it and start building your own game!

## Choose Your Path
🐣 **Beginner mode:** If you're new to game development or working on smaller game productions, you can quickly create a game using the pre-made assets included in the demo game. These assets can be reused and supplemented with additional ones in the same art style, which can be found on the authors' websites (refer to the LICENSE documents for each third-party asset used in the demo game).

💻 **Advanced mode:** For more experienced users working on medium-sized game productions, you can kick-start your game production by using the demo game as a foundation and replacing the assets with your own. Keep in mind that RPG games require a large number of assets, including sprites, animations, music, and sound effects.

🦾 **Expert mode:** If you're an expert user with a strong understanding of Mythril2D and working on larger game productions, you can start building your game from scratch using the core building blocks provided by the toolkit. This approach requires deep knowledge of Mythril2D and significant expertise in game development and design.

## Ready to get started?
To begin, I recommend exploring the available documentation as well as the demo game. The demo game is an excellent resource for gaining a better understanding of how Mythril2D can be used to create unique RPG games. Take a closer look at the demo characters, abilities, maps, and other assets to see how they can be adapted and customized to suit your own vision and game design. With persistence and practice, you can master the tools and features of Mythril2D and create the game you've been dreaming of.
